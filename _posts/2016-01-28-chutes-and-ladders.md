### Chutes & Ladders

<span class="author">By <a href="https://twitter.com/freqn">Chip</a></span>

I received some unexpected news that our entire development team has been shelved and we have two weeks to find new jobs.  News like this hits hard for some and slowly tortures others, especially when you've invested yourself into building a product for a company you believe in with people you love.

I'm a rookie at this layoff thing, but I've kept my network intact.  I'm still processing what happened while lining up interviews and meetings.  I'm both grieved and excited at the same time. Minds are complicated and emotions are a high storm.

The truth is that if I could do it all again I would.  I've gained valuable experience as a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer.  I've also gained few good friends that I've grown to trust. You'll see two close ones on this blog that we're building together.
