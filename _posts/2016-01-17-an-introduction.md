### Agency Fight Night

As a designer Cincinnati is a great place to be.  There's tons of meet ups to go to and tons of design agencies you can join.  This Thursday I went to the first Agency Fight Night.  

Agency Fight Night is an event where the three top agencies in Cincinnati battle it out in five different challenges for the most creative ideas.  The one that gets the highest applause wins the Agency Fight Night belt.  The three agencies that participated were Rockfish Digital, Possible, and Barefoot.  Each challenge had to do something with new Reds marketing ideas.  The Judges that helped make the decision were Major League Baseball CMO Jacqueline Parkes and Procter & Gamble Co. VP Jodi Allen.  

The challenges ranged from creating a facebook post to a poster for a bar.  Each team had a few minutes to come up with an idea and present a finish product for the audience and judges.  Overall I believe each agency had great ideas but Possible brought home the gold.
